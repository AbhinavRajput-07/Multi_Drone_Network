# Multi_Drone_Network
This project is created under Insititute technical summer project(IIT BOMBAY). this project is about the simulation of drones forming pattern or following the pre defined path.</br>
Also a big credit for the completion of this project goes to the intelligent quads github. As a lot of resources like worlds for this project was used from there.

#gazebo part

the two screenshot contains the code for square.cpp which is the file i created for the simulation and has to be replace with the one present in iq_qnc/src/square.cpp as the code that would be avcailable there was created by intelligent quads and it have some issues like collision and delay and others.

my square.cpp code solves these issues as well as like it supports multi drones so basically the changes i made solves the simulation and thus it creates the project more problem solving oriented.

#2d simulation part

the main.cpp ,boids.hpp and boid.cpp files are created using sfml library and are among the first swarm simulation on the internet to use c++ and sfml library
